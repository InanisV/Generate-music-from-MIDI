# Project Composer

Composer is a music generation application hosted on an iOS mobile device. The purpose of the app is to generate music from a provided input and generate harmonization for a given melody.

## The Idea

The aim of the project is to take the input of any music source and create something completely new. For example, Composer could sample an eight-second Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) file clip and come up with the rest, forming a new song right away. This new song would consist of harmonies that accompany the music piece as well.
